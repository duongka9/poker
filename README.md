In this code, the deck of cards is represented as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the rank and suit of a card. The deal_cards function shuffles the deck and deals five cards to each player. The determine_winner function is where you would implement your own poker hand evaluation logic to determine the winning hand.

The main game loop prompts the user to enter the number of players and calls the deal_cards and determine_winner functions accordingly. After determining the winner, the user is asked if they want to play again.

Please note that this simplified version does not include all the rules and hand rankings of poker. You would need to expand and modify the code to create a more comprehensive and interactive poker game.
